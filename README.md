## Demetrius Vissarion

Junior Full Stack Engineer looking to be part of a team that values inclusivity, feedback, continual growth, and communication. Excited about leveraging my diverse skills in HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript, React, and Node.js to contribute to a tech environment that fosters innovation and learning.
After a successful career in construction engineering between 2014 and 2022, I had an accident that forced me to stay at home for 8 months. This time off proved to be an opportunity for me to pursue my lifelong dream of learning how to code and start changing my career towards Information Technology.
